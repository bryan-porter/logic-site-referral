You are an expert designer and front-end developer. Build a SINGLE-PAGE, responsive website for LOGIC Health’s “CCM Revenue Rep Program.”

OBJECTIVE
Create a landing page that CLONES the overall layout, structure, and visual language of this page, but with completely original copy and assets focused on recruiting high-performing CCM reps:

STYLE & STRUCTURE REFERENCE (CLONE THE DESIGN, NOT THE CONTENT):
https://www.amplemarket.com/ads-demo-all-in-one

Use that URL as your ONLY visual and structural reference. Match it as closely as possible in:

Page structure and section order

Layout (hero with form, logo strip, testimonial, “before/after” section, feature grids, event stream, metrics/social proof, final CTA, footer)

Spacing, padding, and visual hierarchy

Typography style (bold modern SaaS headings, clean body text)

Component shapes (cards, buttons, pills, badges, etc.)

Interactions (hover states, scroll behavior, responsiveness)

BUT IMPORTANTLY:

Do NOT copy any of their text, headlines, or microcopy.

Do NOT copy their logo or brand imagery.

Do NOT copy their code (HTML, CSS, or JS).

Use original words and your own code, while making the design feel like a very close structural and stylistic twin.

BRAND & AUDIENCE

Brand: LOGIC Health

Offer: CCM Revenue Rep Program

Audience: Top-performing, results-driven sales reps (pharma, med device, home health, RCM/billing, and other independent healthcare reps) who want to monetize their existing provider relationships. They are independent contractors, commission-only, can be full-time or part-time, and can “add us to their bag.”

TONE & CONTENT PRINCIPLES

Direct, performance- and outcome-oriented, but professional.

Lead with financial upside, leverage, and residual income.

Short, punchy headlines with 1–2 line explanations and bullets.

Emphasize:

Residual commission on recurring CCM revenue

Unlimited upside / no clinic cap

Low operational burden (LOGIC runs CCM)

Ability to bolt on to an existing portfolio of products/services

TECH REQUIREMENTS

Semantic HTML, modern CSS (Flexbox/Grid), light JavaScript as needed.

Fully responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop).

No heavy JS frameworks required.

SECTION-BY-SECTION INSTRUCTIONS
Mirror the sections and flow of the reference page, but adapt all language and imagery to CCM and rep recruiting.

GLOBAL NAV + HERO (CLONE STRUCTURE)

Sticky top navigation visually similar to the reference (logo left, nav links, and a highlighted CTA button).

Replace nav items with revenue- and rep-focused labels, e.g.: “Opportunity,” “Comp & Upside,” “Who It’s For,” “How It Works,” “Apply.”

Hero section:

Big headline focused on income and leverage. Example (rewrite/improve): “Turn Your Clinic Relationships Into Residual Income.”

Subheadline: one sentence about adding CCM to their bag and earning commission on recurring clinic revenue.

Primary CTA button: “Apply to Be a CCM Revenue Rep.”

Secondary CTA: “View Comp Structure” (scroll anchor).

On the right, clone the style and placement of the reference’s hero form, but change the fields to a rep application form:

Fields: Name, Work Email, Current Role, Region(s) Covered, “Estimated Number of Provider Relationships,” and a simple dropdown: “Current Focus (Pharma / Med Device / Home Health / Billing / Other).”

Submit button styled similarly to “Get free trial,” but labeled “Submit Application.”

“TRUSTED BY” STYLE LOGO STRIP

Clone the “Trusted by industry leaders” logo band design.

Replace logos with generic text or placeholder clinic/provider group labels such as:

“Independent Primary Care Group”

“Regional Specialty Network”

“Community Health Clinics”

Maintain the horizontal logo strip look and spacing, but avoid using real brand marks.

TOP TESTIMONIAL / QUOTE BLOCK

Clone the prominent testimonial section style near the top of the reference.

Replace with a fictional rep testimonial focused on revenue and leverage.

Example content direction: how CCM became their most profitable add-on, created a sticky revenue stream, and fit into existing clinic calls.

Attribution: “Healthcare Sales Rep, Southeast Region” (no real names).

Match typography, image/avatar placement, and card style.

“BEFORE / AFTER” SECTION (MAP TO REP ECONOMICS)

Where the reference shows a “before vs with” section, mirror the two-column layout:

Left side: “Before CCM Revenue” with 3 pain-point cards for reps:

“One-off deals with no residuals.”

“Leaving clinic revenue opportunities unused.”

“Limited leverage on existing provider relationships.”

Right side: “With a CCM Revenue Stream” with 3 benefit cards:

“Recurring commission from enrolled CCM patients.”

“Deeper, stickier relationships with clinics.”

“More value for providers with no new staffing burden.”

Preserve the visual tension/layout of the reference, but swap all copy and icons to fit rep economics and CCM.

MAIN FEATURE / VALUE SECTION (CLONE CARD GRID)

Mirror the multi-card feature grid structure from the reference site.

Create 4 core feature cards, each with a clear heading, 1–2 line description, and an icon:

“Residual Commission” – “Earn recurring income as clinics grow their CCM panel.”

“Unlimited Clinics” – “No cap on the number of practices you can enroll.”

“Clinic-First Economics” – “Align with providers by driving new revenue and better patient coverage.”

“Low Operational Load” – “LOGIC Health runs CCM operations; you focus on opening doors.”

“SIGNALS” / EVENT STREAM REIMAGINED FOR CCM & REPS

Where the reference shows a dynamic list of sales signals/events, clone that component’s visual design.

Replace the content with CCM and revenue-relevant “events” reps care about, e.g.:

“Clinic A launches CCM with 40 eligible patients.”

“Clinic B enrolls 10 new CCM patients this month.”

“Your commission from Clinic C just updated.”

“New independent clinic prospect added to your pipeline.”

Display 10–15 concise event lines that visually echo the reference’s signal list, but in CCM-rep terms.

METRICS / SOCIAL PROOF CLUSTER (CLONE STRUCTURE)

Clone the reference’s section with metrics + quote blocks.

Replace metrics with conceptual placeholders tied to rep performance and clinic outcomes (no real stats):

“XX+ clinics supported with CCM.”

“XX CCM patients per active clinic (avg).”

“XX% of reps add CCM to existing portfolios.”

Include 2–3 short quotes from fictional reps or clinic admins about:

Bigger book of business from CCM.

Stickier provider relationships.

Predictable, residual-style income.

“WHO THRIVES IN THIS ROLE” REP PROFILE SECTION

Insert a rep-targeted section that fits into the flow like a feature block from the reference.

Headline: “Who Thrives in This Role”

4 cards for:

“Pharma Sales Reps” – already calling on PCPs and specialists.

“Medical Device Reps” – high-touch relationships in specialty practices.

“Home Health Reps” – close to high-risk patient populations.

“Billing / RCM Reps” – focused on practice finance and recurring revenue.

Each card: one punchy line about layering CCM on top of existing clinic calls.

“HOW IT WORKS” / SIMPLE 3-STEP FUNNEL

In the spot where the reference explains workflow or product steps, create a 3-step funnel for reps:

Step 1: “Apply & Qualify” – Share your background, territory, and provider relationships.

Step 2: “Get Equipped” – Receive CCM training, pitch deck, one-pagers, and simple CRM access.

Step 3: “Activate Your Network” – Approach clinics, identify CCM fit, and hand off interested practices to LOGIC Health.

Use the same type of numbered or icon-based step layout as the reference.

COMP & FLEXIBILTY SECTION (MAP TO A FEATURE/METRIC BLOCK)

Use a layout similar to one of the reference’s feature + visual sections.

Left side (or top on mobile):

Headline: “High-Upside Commission With Flexible Commitment.”

3 bullets:

“Commission-only with residual potential per enrolled clinic.”

“Independent contractor — part-time or full-time.”

“Designed to bolt onto your existing portfolio.”

Right side:

2–3 scenario cards with placeholder math, styled like metric cards:

“Clinic A: XX CCM patients → Approx. $X clinic revenue → Your recurring commission: $Y (placeholder).”

“Clinic A + Clinic B: combined CCM revenue → larger residual stream.”

FINAL CTA SECTION (CLONE FOOTER-ADJACENT CTA)

Clone the visual style of the final high-impact CTA section from the reference page.

Headline: “Ready to Add a New Revenue Stream?”

Subheadline: “Use your existing clinic relationships to drive CCM revenue — and residual income for yourself.”

Prominent button: “Apply to Be a CCM Revenue Rep.”

Optionally include a small secondary link: “Learn more about CCM” (scrolls up to a section or opens an informational modal).

FOOTER (CLONE LAYOUT, CHANGE LINKS)

Match the multi-column footer layout of the reference, but with LOGIC Health content:

Columns like: “Program,” “For Reps,” “For Clinics,” “Resources,” “Contact.”

Use descriptive placeholder links relevant to CCM and the rep program, plus generic “Privacy Policy” and “Terms of Service.”

Include a simple © LOGIC Health 2024 line.

DESIGN & UX DETAILS

Use a color palette inspired by modern SaaS with a performance feel: one strong primary, a secondary accent, and neutral backgrounds, mimicking the reference’s energy and contrast.

Buttons, cards, and interactive elements should have hover states similar in feel to the reference (subtle shadows, movement, or color shifts).

Maintain strong whitespace, consistent spacing, and section rhythm so the page clearly “belongs to” the same design family as the reference.

Ensure all sections stack cleanly on mobile while keeping CTAs highly visible.

ACCESSIBILITY

Maintain good color contrast, keyboard accessibility, and alt text for key imagery.

Forms should have clear labels and intuitive error states.

REMINDER

Clone the design language, layout, and interaction patterns of the reference URL as closely as possible, but write entirely new copy and use your own HTML/CSS/JS implementation tailored to LOGIC Health’s CCM Revenue Rep Program for high-performing, commission-driven sales reps.

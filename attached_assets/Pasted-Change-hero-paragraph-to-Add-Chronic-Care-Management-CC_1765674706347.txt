“Add Chronic Care Management (CCM) to your bag. Earn recurring commissions on clinic revenue without the operational headache. No base salary, no hourly, just performance.”



Application card (right side)
Add a one-line disclaimer inside the form (near the title or above submit).
 Under “See if you qualify for the program.” add:
“Independent contractor (1099). Commission-only. Non-exclusive.”


Replace the tiny footer line under the button.
 Current: “No commitment required. Free to apply.”

Add two fields that force the “bag / cross-sell” framing.
Dropdown: Availability (Part-time / Full-time / Side-by-side with current job)


Checkbox or dropdown: “Are you adding CCM to an existing book of business?” (Yes—existing clinics / Yes—new clinic prospecting / Both)


“Why Reps Are Switching to Residuals” section
This section is strong, but add one hard disqualifier line above the comparison cards:
“This is not a W-2 role. No base salary. Commission-only (1099).”


Feature cards (“Residual Commission / Unlimited Clinics / …”)
add one compact line under the grid:
“Non-exclusive rep role: keep your current products and cross-sell CCM to the same clinics.”


“Real-Time Revenue Signals” section
add one bullet that explicitly frames cross-selling:
“Designed for cross-sell: introduce CCM on your existing clinic calls.”


Replace “"The residual income is real. It took about 3 months to ramp up, but now it covers my mortgage every single month."” with : 

“Added CCM to cross-sell existing clinic relationship.”


“Who Thrives in This Role?” section
Replace “Designed for reps with existing relationships.” with: 
“Best fit: reps already visiting clinics who want a simple add-on offer to cross-sell.”


Add one line to each card to emphasize “bag”:
Pharma: “Add CCM alongside your current portfolio.”


Med device: “Cross-sell to practices you already call on.”

Billing/RCM: “CCM is a clean ‘found revenue’ add-on.”
